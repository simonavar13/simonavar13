## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Simona, and Iâ€™m looking for job opportunities in the field of data analytics.
Iâ€™m passionate about data and problem-solving. I have completed data analytics and SQL courses, where I worked with Python, Pandas, JupyterLab, and SQL.
Currently, Iâ€™m working on projects to showcase my skills.

Even though Iâ€™m a beginner, I have a strong motivation to learn. ðŸ™‚
I would appreciate any feedback so I can improve!
